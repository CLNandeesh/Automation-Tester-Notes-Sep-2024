STEP 1:Recording option setting
-------------------------------
In recording option
 Click on record>Recording options link

setup 1:General->Recording>HTTP based scripts->HTML Advance>Select second option in both 
	This will record only main web requests with all necessary web resources

setup 2:HTTP Properties>Advance>Disable Replace pass with enc parameters

setup 3: Mapping and Filtering>Select Socket level data dropdown

STEP 2: Create Actions, Transactions, Comments and Record the script
--------------------------------------------------------------------
->Create required separate actions and record the script in respective actions only by providing transaction names and comments during recording time itself.
->After recording in Recording report, Check if only required domain has been recorded or not, else remove un necessary domain and re generate the script once.

Step 3: Parameterization
------------------------
->Click on Parameters tab
->Click on New
->Provide LR Param name
->Specify the dat file where data exists.
->If there are other LR params, refers to same file then specify same file path for other LR params and also specify which column to refer[Column number or name]
->Use the LR param in the script where ever needed {LRParam}
 
Note: 
->To do any modification need to convert to C and do
->Any number of dat file can be created for one script




Required LR and C Functions:
//To print any message
lr_output_message("*****Booking Flight Execution Started*****");

//To add start and end transactions
lr_start_transaction("Launch");
lr_end_transaction("Launch",LR_AUTO);
lr_end_transaction("Launch",LR_PASS);
lr_end_transaction("Launch",LR_FAIL);

//LR to C Conversion
char *c=lr_eval_string("Appu {uName}"); 
char *c=lr_eval_string("{uName}"); 
int i=atoi(lr_eval_string("{lrParamName}");  
	
//C to LR
lr_param_sprintf("lrParamName","format specifier",cVarName); //appu 200202022

//To print C var
lr_output_mesage("format specifier",cVariableName);

//To print LR Param var
convert to c and print
int a=atoi(lr_eval_string("{lrParam}"));
lr_output_mesage("%d",a);


Note:
->LR Param can be directly used in script but C var cannot be used directly in the script. Need to be converted to LR param before using in the script.
->To perform any operation, LR param need to be converted to C. 
->Always create the scripts in Vugen, execute it with multiple users[different creds/parameterization] for multiple iteration[correlation] so to make sure all parameterization and correlation is working fine.

Script Names||Single iteration||Multiple Iteration||Multiple iteration with multiple users[creds different]||Final status
Book flight    pass              pass               pass                                                       PASS
Cancel flight  pass              pass               pass                                                       PASS
